TASK
────────────────────────────────
Read the dialogue below and decide which SINGLE DBT skills module
is most urgently indicated for the client *at this moment*.

Module definitions
1. Mindfulness
   • Client appears unaware of present-moment sensations, thoughts, feelings.
   • Excessive judging, rumination about past/future, or “numb” / dissociated.

2. Distress Tolerance
   • Client reports overwhelming pain or urges to escape, self-harm, substance use.
   • Situation cannot be changed immediately; they need short-term coping.

3. Emotion Regulation
   • Intense, rapidly shifting, or out-of-proportion emotions.
   • Difficulty understanding, naming, or modulating emotions; urges drive behaviour.

4. Interpersonal Effectiveness
   • Problems asking for needs, saying no, or managing conflict.
   • Relationship turmoil, fear of abandonment, or guilt from over-pleasing.

Guidelines
• Choose the ONE module whose skills would most effectively reduce suffering now.
• If you detect suicidal ideation, self-harm urges, or life-threatening crisis → module = Distress Tolerance.
• If unclear, select Mindfulness as default.
• Output must match the exact JSON schema below.
