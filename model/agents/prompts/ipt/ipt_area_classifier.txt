TASK
────────────────────────────────
Read the dialogue below and decide which SINGLE IPT problem area best explains the client’s CURRENT depressive episode.

Problem‑area definitions
1. Grief
   • Onset after death of a significant person.
   • Intense yearning, guilt, anger, preoccupation with the deceased.
   • Difficulty resuming roles or performing mourning rituals.
   • Anniversaries or reminders trigger mood drops.

2. Disputes
   • Ongoing overt fights OR silent cold conflict with spouse, family, friend, coworker.
   • Conflicting expectations, blame, “who is right.”
   • Stalemate or broken communication; third‑party involvement sometimes escalates tension.

3. Role Transition
   • Recent / impending life change (job loss, relocation, marriage, divorce, illness, retirement, parenthood, migration, poverty shift).
   • Ambivalence: mixes loss, grief, excitement, anxiety.
   • Feels unprepared for new demands; clings to old role or identity; loss of support network.

4. Loneliness/Isolation
   • Long‑standing lack of close, supportive relationships.
   • Few or no confidants; difficulty initiating or maintaining ties.
   • Heightened sense of being different, unwanted, or left out; social withdrawal.

Guidelines
• Choose the area that appears most closely linked to LOW MOOD **now**.
• Ignore past events no longer affecting present mood.
• If several appear, pick the one the dialogue emphasises as primary distress.
• Output must match the exact JSON schema below—no extra keys, no comments.
