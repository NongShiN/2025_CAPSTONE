TASK
────────────────────────────────
Classify which phase of 1‑to‑1 IPT the conversation is presently in.

IPT phase markers
• Initial phase
  – Build rapport, provide depression psycho‑education.
  – Create interpersonal inventory; link mood ↔ problem area.
  – Select focal problem area and set specific goals.
  – Little or no skills practice yet.

• Middle phase
  – Review weekly mood ratings & real‑life events.
  – Apply problem‑area strategies: communication analysis, role‑play, decision analysis, behavioural activation, etc.
  – Assign & debrief practice/homework tasks.
  – Emotion often heightened as client tackles focal issue.

• Termination phase
  – Summarise achievements; compare mood baseline → now.
  – Review skills, strategies, and relapse‑prevention plan.
  – Discuss future supports, possible boosters, or referrals.
  – Acknowledge ending and client’s feelings about closure.

Guidelines
• Detect therapist tasks, not client sentiment alone.
• If conversation shows mixed signals, choose the phase that dominates most of the exchange.
• Output must match the exact JSON schema below—no extra keys, no commentary.
