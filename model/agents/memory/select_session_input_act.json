          "response": "I hear you, and it sounds like you're grappling with some deep fears about existence and what it means to be alive. It's completely understandable to feel anxious about the idea of death and the unknown; many people share these thoughts at various points in their lives. Instead of pushing those feelings away, it might help to sit with them and explore what they reveal about your values and what truly matters to you. Remember, you're not alone in this, and we can work through these feelings together to find some peace and understanding. How do you feel about discussing what brings you joy or meaning in your life?",

          "response": "I can sense how heavy this fear of death feels for you, and it's really important to acknowledge the weight of those thoughts. It's true that life is fragile, and it's natural to feel a sense of anxiety over its impermanence. While the inevitability of death can be daunting, it often invites us to reflect on what makes our lives meaningful and precious right now. Perhaps we can explore what brings you comfort or joy in the midst of these fears, allowing you to connect with the beauty of the present moment. I'm here to support you as we navigate these feelings together.",

          "response": "It sounds like these thoughts about death are really weighing on you, especially at night when everything feels quieter. It might be helpful to try to observe those thoughts from a distance, almost like watching clouds pass by in the sky. You could even try saying to yourself, \"I am having the thought that I am afraid of death\" to create some space between you and that fear. In the midst of this, what are some small actions or moments that bring you joy or connect you to what truly matters? Focusing on those values can help anchor you in the present, even when those heavy thoughts arise. I'm here to support you as you explore this together.",
